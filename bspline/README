@section documentation Documentation

For an overview of the library and its usage, see the documentation for the
BSplineBase class.

There is no documentation (as yet) on any of the mathematical details of
the implementation.  Refer to the Ooyama article, and there may be some
notes in the source.

The HTML documentation is generated from the source files by Doxygen
(http://www.doxygen.org).  Thanks to Dimitri for a great tool.

@section releasenotes Release Notes

This release updates the code to compile with GCC 3.2, which enforces more
standards compliance like the use of 'typename'.  Also the GNU libstdc++ no
longer uses pointers as vector iterators, so occurences of
vector<>::begin() have been replaced with &(vector[0])

Lastly, in this release the C++ filename extension has been changed from
cxx to cpp.

@section background Background

This is a C++ implementation of a cubic b-spline least squares and
derivative constraint algorithm.  See the documentation for the BSplineBase
class (in BSpline/BSpline.h) for details.

This work was done for meteorological research at the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (http://www.ucar.edu/).  There is no
warranty of any kind.  Please see the COPYRIGHT file.

@section installation Installation

As the implementation itself is mostly template code, it is not necessary
to build the library separately.  The template implementation can be
included directly.  The templates can also be compiled for the usual float
and double types into their own object modules and library (DLL on Win32).
See the documentation for details.  The code is known to compile under the
GNU g++ compiler 3.2 (http://gcc.gnu.org/) and Microsft Developer Studio
Visual C++ version 6.0.

The distribution contains two parts.  The b-spline code itself is
contained in the lib/ directory, while the top directory only contains a
test driver program.  There are MS VC++ projects and/or workspaces for
both, but they may not be current.  On UNIX, running make in the top
directory builds only the driver program by including the template
implementation directly.  Run make in the lib directory to build a library
with float and double instantiations of the BSpline templates.

To install the code into an include directory, all of the *.cxx and *.h
files in lib/ must be copied into the include directory.

@section questions Questions

I'd be happy to try to answer any questions, and certainly happy to hear
about any bugs or improvements.
